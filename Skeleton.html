    <h2> Declaring the form of the website </h2> 
      <p>
    !DOCTYPEhtml <br> <br>
    This is the declaration for a website. In the same way that we declare what we want to accomplish when we grow up, we declare the type of code that we want to run for the website. Where in both cases the delcarations needed would reflect how we see younger selves. Our foundation. And what makes us feel that we need a form of change through creativity and logical planning.

    <h2>Standard website structure </h2>
      <p> HTML -> Head -> Body </p>
      
    <p> In the same way that we structure code to fit the syntax needed for a website to read it's contents, we tend to formulate a plan that will help us identify ourselves in the future. Where we take into account aspects such as: how we plan to conduct our plan, factors such as social skills, and our own improvements, in the same we a programmer would check in for how the website looks and how it can be improved upon later on.
