    <h2> Declaring the form of the website </h2> 
      <p>
    !DOCTYPEhtml <br> <br>
    This is the declaration for a website. In the same way that we declare what we want to accomplish when we grow up, we declare the type of code that we want to run for the website. Where in both cases the delcarations needed would reflect how we see younger selves. Our foundation. And what makes us feel that we need a form of change through creativity and logical planning.
